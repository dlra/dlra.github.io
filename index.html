         Burgess Park was built between the 1950s and 1980s. It came about as a result of the Abecrombie Plan in 1943, which set out ideas for open spaces in London. It is still a 'live' park, inasmuch as it is unfinished in its development.

    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="profile">A little late to the party with producing this website, it was a bit rushed in the end and is still a work in progress. I only found out about Founders and Coders recently, a friend mentioned, I knew it was something I had to apply to. Having completed my PhD in 2014&mdash;having
      spent a few years mostly playing around with <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-graphene-story-how-andrei-geim-and-kostya-novoselov-hit-on-a-scientific-breakthrough-that-8539743.html">sticky tape and bits of pencil lead</a>&mdash;I
      realised direct scientific research wasn't for me. Cue some wilderness years (bar work, exploring). I've always loved logic and analysis; and really do like the incremental and tangible progress that is made from a hard day's graft at the keyboard&mdash;
      ok, on a good day. We could be a match made in heaven! Check me out at <a href=h ttps://www.freecodecamp.com/dlra>freeCodeCamp</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/dlra">codewars</a>. I look forward to hearing from you.
