# London Parks
Since living in London I've come to love its parks. They come in all different shapes and sizes and terrains, and have different things to offer. I'll try to cover a few of them, and give reasons for why I like them.

## Layout
The idea is, after an intro, to be able to scroll down and go through each park one-by-one. The functionality will be simple:
* Text--Images--Menu. Each button on the menu should be attached to an image and corresponsing text. 3 or 4 buttons.
* The layout of the buttons will be responsive to the screen display (e.g., desktop, tablet or phone).

### To do
A few things need fleshing out and tidying up. Specifically:

* Need to add more content.
* Need to add button interactivity
* Need to improve appearance with respect to layout.

The top menu is currently a bit unnecessary due to the lack of content. Hopefully will have been worth the development once content has been added.
